abstract = {The Rust programming language provides a powerful type system that checks linearity and borrowing, allowing code to safely manipulate memory without garbage collection and making Rust ideal for developing low-level, high-assurance systems. For such systems, formal verification can be useful to prove functional correctness properties beyond type safety. This paper presents Verus, an SMT-based tool for formally verifying Rust programs.  
With Verus, programmers express proofs and specifications using the Rust language, allowing proofs to take advantage of Rust's linear types and borrow checking. We show how this allows proofs to manipulate linearly typed permissions that let Rust code safely manipulate memory, pointers, and concurrent resources. Verus organizes proofs and specifications using a novel mode system that distinguishes specifications, which are not checked for linearity and borrowing, from executable code and proofs, which are checked for linearity and borrowing.  
We formalize Verus' linearity, borrowing, and modes in a small lambda calculus, for which we prove type safety and termination of specifications and proofs. We demonstrate Verus on a series of examples, including pointer-manipulating code (an xor-based doubly linked list), code with interior mutability, and concurrent code.},

abstract = {Rust is a modern systems programming language whose ownership-based type system statically guarantees memory safety, making it particularly well-suited to the domain of safety-critical systems. In recent years, a wellspring of automated deductive verification tools have emerged for establishing functional correctness of Rust code. However, none of the previous tools produce foundational proofs (machine-checkable in a general-purpose proof assistant), and all of them are restricted to the safe fragment of Rust. This is a problem because the vast majority of Rust programs make use of unsafe code at critical points, such as in the implementation of widely-used APIs. We propose RefinedRust, a refinement type system—proven sound in the Coq proof assistant—with the goal of establishing foundational semi-automated functional correctness verification of both safe and unsafe Rust code. We have developed a prototype verification tool implementing RefinedRust. Our tool translates Rust code (with user annotations) into a model of Rust embedded in Coq, and then checks its adherence to the RefinedRust type system using separation logic automation in Coq. All proofs generated by RefinedRust are checked by the Coq proof assistant, so the automation and type system do not have to be trusted. We evaluate the effectiveness of RefinedRust by verifying a variant of Rust’s Vec implementation that involves intricate reasoning about unsafe pointer-manipulating code.},

abstract = {Early in the development of Hoare logic, Owicki and Gries introduced auxiliary variables as a way of encoding information about the history of a program’s execution that is useful for verifying its correctness. Over a decade later, Abadi and Lamport observed that it is sometimes also necessary to know in advance what a program will do in the future. To address this need, they proposed prophecy variables, originally as a proof technique for refinement mappings between state machines. However, despite the fact that prophecy variables are a clearly useful reasoning mechanism, there is (surprisingly) almost no work that attempts to integrate them into Hoare logic. In this paper, we present the first account of prophecy variables in a Hoare-style program logic that is flexible enough to verify logical atomicity (a relative of linearizability) for classic examples from the concurrency literature like RDCSS and the Herlihy-Wing queue. Our account is formalized in the Iris framework for separation logic in Coq. It makes essential use of ownership to encode the exclusive right to resolve a prophecy, which in turn enables us to enforce soundness of prophecies with a very simple set of proof rules.},

abstract = {Rust is a modern systems programming language designed to offer both performance and static safety. A key distinguishing feature is a strong type system, which enforces by default that memory is either shared or mutable, but never both. This guarantee is used to prevent common pitfalls such as memory errors and data races. It can also be used to greatly simplify formal verification, as we demonstrated by developing the Prusti verifier, which can verify rich correctness properties of Rust programs with a very modest annotation overhead. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Prusti project. We outline its main design goals, illustrate examples of its use, and discuss important outcomes from the perspectives of a user, a verification expert, and a tool developer.},

abstract = {Rust is a fairly recent programming language for system programming, bringing static guarantees of memory safety through a strict ownership policy. The strong guarantees brought by this feature opens promising progress for deductive verification, which aims at proving the conformity of Rust code with respect to a specification of its intended behavior. We present the foundations of Creusot, a tool for the formal specification and deductive verification of Rust code. A first originality comes from Creusot’s specification language, which features a notion of prophecy to reason about memory mutation, working in harmony with Rust’s ownership system. A second originality is how Creusot builds upon Rust trait system to provide several advanced abstraction features.},
